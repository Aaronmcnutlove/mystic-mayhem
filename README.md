Mystic Mayhem is a 2D action game built in Godot using C#. I worked on this as part of a four person team.

## What I did

- Built and tested gameplay features in Godot using C#
- Created all in game sprite artwork using Krita
- Helped debug collision issues, enemy behavior, and level flow
- Documented how to add new art assets and keep the project organized

## Tech and tools

- Godot Engine
- C#
- Krita (sprite art)
- Git for version control

## Running the project

1. Install Godot (matching the version used for the project).
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. Open the project in Godot and run from the editor.
